# Automated Testing

## Introduction

Automated testing is a key part of CI/CD. It ensures your Selenium tests are run consistently, giving you confidence that your code changes do not break existing functionality.

> Tip: In this course, automated testing is integrated into your CI workflow, so no additional setup is required.

## Why Automated Testing Matters

- **Catch Bugs Early:** Detect problems before they reach production.  
- **Increase Efficiency:** Avoid manual testing and repetitive work.  
- **Maintain Stability:** Ensure changes don’t break existing functionality.  
- **Support Collaboration:** Multiple developers can safely merge code.

## How Automated Testing Works Here

- Your **Selenium tests** are already included in the Maven project.  
- The GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs these tests on every push or pull request.  
- Test results are visible in the **Actions tab** of GitHub.

## Optional Extensions for Students

- **TestNG Reports:** Customize reporting to see detailed test outcomes.  
- **Parallel Test Execution:** Run multiple Selenium tests at the same time to save time.  
- **Multiple Browsers:** Configure GitHub Actions matrix builds to run tests on different browsers.  
- **Future Learning:** Explore other testing tools like JUnit, Mockito, or Cypress for different scenarios.

## ✅ Summary

- Automated testing is fully integrated into CI/CD for Selenium in this course.  
- Students focus on writing and maintaining Selenium tests.  
- GitHub Actions ensures tests run consistently and reliably with every code change.

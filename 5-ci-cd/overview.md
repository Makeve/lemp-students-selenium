# Introduction to CI/CD  

## Overview  
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices that help software teams **release updates faster, with fewer bugs, and more confidence.**  

Think of CI/CD as a way to **put your development on autopilot** — every time you write new code, the system tests it, integrates it, and (if all checks pass) can automatically deploy it.  

## Why CI/CD is Important  

- **Efficiency**: Automates testing and deployment, reducing manual steps.  
- **Quality**: Automated tests catch problems early before they reach users.  
- **Collaboration**: Encourages teams to integrate changes frequently and avoid big, messy code merges.  
- **Reliability**: Reduces deployment failures by making releases smaller, more frequent, and predictable.  

## Tools and Technologies  

- **GitHub Actions** → Automates workflows (CI/CD pipelines).  
- **Deployment Tools** → Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).  
- **Testing Frameworks** → JUnit, Selenium, Cypress, etc., for automated testing.  

## Steps Covered in This Module  

1. **Introduction to CI/CD** → Why it matters, benefits, and best practices.  
2. **Setting Up CI with GitHub Actions** → Automating builds and tests.  
3. **Deploying Applications** → Strategies and tools for releasing code.  
4. **Automated Testing** → Ensuring reliability and quality with test automation.  

## Prerequisites  

- **GitHub Account** → Make sure you have one set up.  
- **Basic understanding of CI/CD** → We’ll expand on this in the next section.  
- **Basic knowledge of deployment tools** → Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud basics.  
- **Experience with testing frameworks** → Familiarity with automated testing tools.  

✅ By the end of this module, you will have a **practical understanding of CI/CD** and know how to implement it in your own projects.

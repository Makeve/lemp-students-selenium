# Introduction to CI/CD  

## Overview  
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices that help software teams **release updates faster, with fewer bugs, and more confidence.**  

Think of CI/CD as a way to **put your development on autopilot** — every time you write new code, the system tests it, integrates it, and (if all checks pass) can automatically deploy it.  

## Why CI/CD is Important  

- **Efficiency**: Automates testing and deployment, reducing manual steps.  
- **Quality**: Automated tests catch problems early before they reach users.  
- **Collaboration**: Encourages teams to integrate changes frequently and avoid big, messy code merges.  
- **Reliability**: Reduces deployment failures by making releases smaller, more frequent, and predictable.  

## Tools and Technologies  

- **GitHub Actions:** Automates workflows and runs CI pipelines.
- **Testing Frameworks:** Selenium (for browser automation), TestNG, JUnit.
- **Optional Tools for the Future:** Mockito (for unit testing), Cypress (for frontend testing). 

## Steps Covered in This Module  

- **Introduction to CI/CD:** Understand the benefits and best practices.
- **Setting Up CI with GitHub Actions:** Automate builds and test execution.
- **Running Tests in CI/CD:** Run Selenium tests automatically and check results.
- **Automated Testing:** Learn the role of automated testing in CI/CD pipelines. 

## Prerequisites  

- **GitHub Account:** Ensure you have one set up.
- **Basic understanding of CI/CD:** Familiarity with the concept is helpful.
- **Experience with testing frameworks:** Basic knowledge of Selenium, TestNG, or JUnit.

✅ By the end of this module, you will have a practical understanding of CI/CD for Selenium testing and be able to implement automated test pipelines using GitHub Actions.

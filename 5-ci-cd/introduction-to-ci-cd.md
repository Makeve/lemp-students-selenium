# Introduction to CI/CD Contd.

## What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous delivery.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. CI aims to provide rapid feedback so that if a defect is introduced into the codebase, it can be identified and corrected as soon as possible.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Deployment is the practice of automatically deploying every code change that passes the automated tests to a production environment. This ensures that the software is always in a deployable state and can be released to users at any time.

### Continuous Delivery (CD)

Continuous Delivery is the practice of ensuring that the codebase is always in a state that can be deployed to production at any time. It involves rigorous automated testing to provide assurance that the application will work as expected in production.

## Benefits of CI/CD

- **Faster Time to Market**: Automating the integration, testing, and deployment processes allows teams to deliver features and fixes faster.
- **Improved Quality**: Automated tests help catch issues early, reducing the risk of bugs in production.
- **Reduced Risk**: Frequent, smaller updates are easier to troubleshoot and roll back if something goes wrong.
- **Better Collaboration**: CI/CD practices encourage developers to work together more closely and integrate their changes frequently.

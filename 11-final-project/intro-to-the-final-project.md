# Introduction to the Final Project

## Overview

The final project is designed to give you hands-on experience with automating test cases for a typical e-commerce website. You will define and write test cases for core functionalities such as logging in, adding items to the cart, and checking out, using the Sauce Demo website (https://www.saucedemo.com/).

## Objectives

1. **Define Test Cases**: Learn to identify and define meaningful test cases for an e-commerce website.
2. **Write Test Cases**: Implement the test cases using Cucumber and Selenium.

## Project Scenario

Imagine you are working for an e-commerce company, and your task is to ensure the website functions correctly by automating the testing of its core features.

### Features to Test

1. **Login**: Verify that users can log in with valid credentials.
2. **Add to Cart**: Ensure users can add items to their shopping cart.
3. **Checkout**: Confirm that users can complete the checkout process.
4. **Order and Remove Items**: Verify that users can order and remove items from their shopping cart.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Cucumber**: For writing BDD test cases in Gherkin syntax.
- **Selenium**: For automating web browser interactions.
- **GitHub Actions**: For setting up a CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically.

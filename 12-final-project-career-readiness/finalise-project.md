# Hands-on Exercise: Finalise Project & Run All Test Cases

## Introduction

In this hands-on exercise, you will finalise your project and run all test cases. This exercise will help you ensure that your test automation project is complete and all test cases are running successfully.

## Objectives

1. **Finalize the Project**: Ensure that all test cases are implemented and the project is complete.
2. **Run All Test Cases**: Execute all test cases to verify that they pass successfully.
3. **Analyze Results**: Review the test results and ensure that there are no failures.

## Steps

### Step 1: Finalize the Project

- Review your project to ensure that all required test cases are implemented.
- Ensure that the code is well-organized and follows best practices.
- Add any missing documentation or comments.

### Real-World Analogy

Think of finalizing the project as preparing a dish before serving it to guests. You ensure that everything is in place, the presentation is perfect, and nothing is missing.

### Step 2: Run All Test Cases

- Execute all test cases using your test runner.
- Ensure that all test cases pass successfully.

**Example**:
```java
public class TestRunner {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JUnitCore.runClasses(AllTests.class);
    }
}
```

### Real-World Analogy

Running all test cases is like conducting a final rehearsal before a big performance. You ensure that everything works as expected and there are no surprises.

### Step 3: Analyze Results

- Review the test results to ensure that there are no failures.
- If any test cases fail, debug and fix the issues.

### Real-World Analogy

Analyzing results is like reviewing feedback after a performance. You identify what went well and what needs improvement.

### Example

**Test Results**:
```
Results:
  Tests run: 10, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
```

## Summary

By the end of this hands-on exercise, you should have a finalized test automation project with all test cases implemented and passing successfully. This exercise will help you ensure that your project is complete and ready for demonstration.

# Session 8: Locators

## Mastering Selenium Locators & Interacting with Web Elements

Locators are the **backbone of Selenium automation**. To interact with anything on a web page, like buttons, text fields, checkboxes, or dropdowns. Selenium first needs to **find** that element. Locators are the way we point Selenium to the right element in the browser.  

In this session, you‚Äôll learn how to use all the different types of locators and practice writing Selenium scripts that interact with real web pages.

And our browser of choice will be: **Google Chrome**.  

### üí° Why This Matters  

If you can‚Äôt **find elements correctly**, your tests will fail. Mastering locators is the **most important skill in Selenium automation**. This session gives you a solid foundation so you can write reliable, maintainable test scripts.

# Session 9: Handling Web Elements

Welcome to Session 9! ðŸŽ‰  
In this session, weâ€™ll go beyond the basics and learn how to handle **dynamic web elements** and apply different types of **waits** to make our Selenium scripts more reliable.

When testing real websites, elements donâ€™t always load instantly â€” they may appear late, disappear, or change dynamically. Knowing how to handle such cases is a must-have skill for every automation tester.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

1. [Techniques to Handle Dynamic Web Elements](techniques-to-handle-dynamic-web-elements.md)  
   Learn how to locate and interact with elements that change frequently (like ads, popups, or live content).  

2. [Implementing Waits (Implicit, Explicit, and Fluent Waits)](implementing-waits.md)  
   Discover how to pause your test intelligently until elements are ready, avoiding flaky and failing tests.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you will be able to:
- Identify and interact with **dynamic elements** on a webpage.  
- Use **implicit waits** for general synchronization.  
- Apply **explicit waits** for specific conditions (e.g., waiting for a button to be clickable).  
- Implement **fluent waits** to handle advanced cases with custom polling.

## What is Git?

Git is a powerful tool that helps developers manage and keep track of changes in their code. Think of it as a highly organized notebook where every change you make to your code is recorded. This way, if you ever need to look back at previous versions or understand what changes were made and when, Git can show you.

### Simple Explanation:
Imagine you're writing a long essay. You write a draft, make some changes, delete a few paragraphs, and add new ones. If you were using Git, it would save each version of your essay every time you make a change. You can then go back and see exactly what you wrote in previous versions, who made the changes (if you're working with others), and why those changes were made. 

Git does this for code, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project without getting in each other's way. It helps keep everything organized and ensures that no work is lost or overwritten.

### Key Points:
- **Version Control**: Git keeps track of every change made to your code, allowing you to revert to any previous version if needed.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each otherâ€™s work.
- **Branching and Merging**: Developers can work on separate features in parallel (branches) and later combine their work (merge).
- **Backup**: Git acts as a backup system, ensuring that your work is saved and can be restored in case of any issues.

By using Git, developers can collaborate more effectively, maintain a history of their work, and ensure that their code is well-organized and backed up.

### How Git Works:
1. **Repository (Repo)**: A repository is like a folder where all your project files and the history of changes are stored.
2. **Commit**: A commit is like taking a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. It's a record of what changes were made and why.
3. **Branch**: A branch is a separate line of development. You can create a branch to work on a new feature without affecting the main project.
4. **Merge**: Merging combines changes from different branches into one.

You should have already installed the Git CLI during the [Software Installation prerequisite section](./installation_guide.md).

Git is probably the most used tool as a developer, so it is essential you understand the core concepts, which will be used throughout the developer toolcamp course.

# Introduction to Git Workflows

## Overview

Git workflows are essential for managing your codebase efficiently, especially when working in teams. This module will guide you through various Git workflows and best practices, ensuring you can handle version control like a pro.

### Importance of Git Workflows

1. **Version Control**: Keep track of changes in your codebase.
2. **Collaboration**: Facilitate teamwork by managing contributions from multiple developers.
3. **Code Quality**: Ensure high code quality through structured workflows and review processes.
4. **History Tracking**: Maintain a detailed history of changes for debugging and auditing purposes.

### Tools and Technologies

1. **Git**: A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code.
2. **GitHub**: A web-based platform for version control and collaboration.
3. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Tools like IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, or Eclipse for writing and managing code.

### Steps Covered in This Module

1. **Basic Git Commands**: Fundamental Git commands for everyday use.
2. **Branching and Merging**: Creating and managing branches, and merging changes.
3. **Resolving Conflicts**: Handling conflicts that arise during merging or rebasing.
4. **Collaborative Workflows**: Different workflows for team collaboration, such as GitFlow and Forking Workflow.
5. **Commit Best Practices**: Writing meaningful commit messages and structuring commits effectively.

### Prerequisites

1. **Git Installation**: Ensure Git is installed on your local machine.
2. **GitHub Account**: Create a GitHub account if you do not already have one.
3. **IDE Installation**: Install and set up your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Eclipse).

By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of Git workflows and be able to manage your codebase efficiently.
